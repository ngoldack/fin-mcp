# Entrypoint for the OTel eBPF auto-instrumented runtime image.
#
# The OpenTelemetry Go auto-instrumentation agent is a *separate* privileged
# process that attaches to a running target binary via eBPF. It does not exec
# the target itself; it discovers it through OTEL_GO_AUTO_TARGET_EXE.
#
# This script therefore:
#   1. Starts the application in the background.
#   2. Starts the eBPF agent, which attaches to that application.
#   3. Forwards termination signals for a graceful shutdown.
#   4. Exits with the application's exit code once it terminates.
#
# Written for POSIX /bin/sh (Alpine busybox) — no bashisms (e.g. `wait -n`).

# 3. Forward SIGTERM/SIGINT to both children for a clean shutdown.
